# README: Code Vision

## Project Set Up

Make sure you have downloaded the latest versions of Node.js, Yarn, and React Native. We will be using yarn as our package manager.
To run the application, the easiest way is to download the Expo app on your mobile device. Then, run ```yarn global add expo-cli ``` to 
install expo-cli.

Next, download the dependencies by running yarn. To run the app from your device, run ``` yarn start ``` and scan the QR code with your 
mobile device. This will open up your app in the Expo app. Make sure you are on the same wifi for both your phone and computer.
